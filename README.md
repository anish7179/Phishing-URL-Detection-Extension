## 🧩 How It Works

The Phishing URL Detector employs multiple analysis techniques to identify potential threats:

1. **URL Feature Extraction**: Analyzes domain length, path structure, special characters, and other URL components
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies suspicious patterns commonly found in phishing URLs
3. **Domain Age Verification**: Checks how recently domains were registered
4. **Keyword Analysis**: Scans for suspicious terms frequently used in phishing attempts
5. **Subdomain Analysis**: Evaluates the complexity and structure of subdomains

Based on these factors, the extension calculates a risk score and classifies URLs as either legitimate or potentially dangerous.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

The extension is built using:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Local storage for settings and history management
- Domain age verification API integration (simulated in current version)

Key components:
- `background.js`: Core analysis engine and background service
- `popup.js`: User interface controller
